&#x26A0;&#xFE0F; Work in progress... This year, I'm working on a
progressive web app for pharmacy students, with two classmates. This
serious game, developed with Node.js and React, offers quizzes and
duels between students to learn easily.

&#x1F393; I am very interested in mobile development, especially for
the Apple ecosystem. In summer 2019, I learned how to develop an iOS
app by discovering Swift, SwiftUI and Xcode. I then published in the
App Store an application,
[SchoolExams](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/schoolexams/id1527399525)
to help students keep track of their grades.

&#x1F3E6; In 2019, I did a 3-month internship. I was in charge of the development
of a web application for bankers. The app was developed with PHP
and JavaScript.

&#x1F579;&#xFE0F; In freshman year, as part of my studies, two friends and I recreated
[the game Pang](https://pang.valentin-perignon.fr) in JavaScript.

&#x1F4F1; Mobile development is a very interesting field. For this
reason, I know the Swift language, and I know how to work with the
SwiftUI framework. Moreover, I know how to use the Xcode IDE.

&#x1F310; I am passionate about the web. I have been using HTML and
CSS for many years. I often use PHP and JavaScript. I also know how to
work with Node.js and the React framework.

&#x1F5A5;&#xFE0F; Java, C and C++ are three languages I am used to
working with.

For my projects, I work with Git and GitHub or GitLab.

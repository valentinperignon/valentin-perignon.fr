Hello! My name is Valentin Perignon. I am a 20-year-old third year
computer science student at the University of Franche-Comt√©, in France
&#x1F1EB;&#x1F1F7;.

I am deeply interested in the languages of the web. If you are seeking
me, I am probably writing some JavaScript or CSS. I like to discover
and learn new things. I am often immersed in books or websites to
deepen my knowledge or get new ones.

&#x1F9D1;&#x200D;&#x1F4BB; I am looking for an internship from April
6, 2021, for a minimum of 3 months. Feel free to contact me.

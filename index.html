          Hello! My name is Valentin Perignon. I am a 20-year-old third year
          computer science student at the University of Franche-Comté, in
          France.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am deeply interested in the languages of the web. If you are seeking
          me, I am probably writing some JavaScript or CSS. I like to discover
          and learn new things. I am often immersed in books or websites to
          deepen my knowledge, or get new ones.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am looking for an internship from April 6, 2021, for a minimum of 3
          months. Feel free to contact me.
        </p>

        <p>
          Work in progress... This year, I'm working on a progressive web app
          for pharmacy students, with two classmates. This serious game,
          developed with Node.js and React, offers quizzes and duels between
          students to learn easily.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a student, I like to keep track of my grades. How can I do this
          easily on a daily basis, with a solution that could help other
          students? By developing an application of course! I created an iOS app
          with Swift and SwiftUI, called SchoolExams.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2019, I was involved in the development of a web application for
          bankers. I did a 3 month internship in the French bank Crédit Agricole
          de Franche-Comté.
        </p>

        <p>
          In freshman year, as part of my studies, I recreated the game Pang in
          JavaScript. I was helped by two friends. You can take up the challenge
          here.

        <p>
          Didn't I tell you? I'm passionate about web development! I can use
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. Also Node.js and React.js.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am very interested in mobile development as well. I know Swift and
          SwiftUI.
        </p>

        <p>Finally, I have system development skills with C, C++ and Java.</p>
